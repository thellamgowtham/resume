ACADEMIC PROJECT:
</h6>
•	Title		:  Controlling speed of vehicles in restricted areas.<br>
•	Organization	: Saveetha School of Engineering.<br>
•	Team size	: 3 members.<br>
•	Duration	: 2 months.<br>
Description:  <br>
	This project is mainly developed for automatic control speed of vehicles. In heavy vehicles like trucks, lorries etc., we introduce a RF-Receiver, which receives the signals from RF-Transmitter at speed restricted areas, therefore the speed gets automatically fixed to the predefined value, which prevents the increase in accidents.
